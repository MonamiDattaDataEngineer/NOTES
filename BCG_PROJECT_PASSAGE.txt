HI THIS IS MONAMI DATTA.I AM A PART OF KPMG DIGITAL LIGHTHOUSE TEAM.I HAVE 4 YEARS OF WORK EXP.
MY PRIMARY SKILLSET LIES INTO WORKING WITH AWS,SPARKSQL,REDSHIFT,GITHUB,QLIKSENSE AND SNOWFLAKES.
MY SECONDARY COMPETENCY LIES IN PYTHON AND PYSPARK
I HAVE FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE IN DOMAINS LIKE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR , LOGISTICS & SUPPLYCHAIN  AND SALES.



MY PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS OF A DEVELOPER            WORKING ON DATA MODELLING AND DATA DESIGNING.
I have worked IN SQL WHERE I HAVE USED KEY FUNCTIONS like WINDOW FUNC(RANK FUNC,DENSE RANK,ROW FUNC)DATE FUNC,ARITHMATIC FUNCTIONS,JOINS,UNION AND 
ALSO WORKED WITH THE STORED PROCEDURES AND CTE.

I HAVE BEEN A BACKEND DEVELOPER INITIALLY BUT THEN STARTED WORKING IN FRONT END WITH DATA MODELLING.

AS A DATA MODELLER,WE DEFINED AND IDENTIFIED  FACT TABLES AND DIMENSION TABLES , BUILD STAR AND  SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA, IDENTIFIED DATA SOURCES, DATA FLOWS
 AND   KEY DATA ELEMENTS NECESSARY FOR OLTP SYSTEMS(LIKE PRIMARY KEYS,FOREIGN KEYS,TRANSACTIONAL DATE,TIMESTAMPS,INDEXES,ETC) 
 AND OLAP SYSTEMS(LIKE MEASURES,AGGREGATES,CALCULATED FLDS,METADATA ,FACT & DIMENTION TABLES)
LOOKING INTO FRONT END AS TO WHAT COLUMNS NEED TO BE FIT IN  TERMS OF TABLE OR A VIEW WHICH WILL HELP IN FASTER PERFORMANCE AND ALSO ENHANCED  THE
PERFORMANCE WITH VARIOUS OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES(LIKE NORMALISATIONS FOR OLTP , DE-NORMALISATION FOR OLAP,PARTITIONING,MATERIALIZED VIEWS,
CONCURENCY CONTROL , ETC)


THATS A LITTLE BRIEF ABOUT MYSELF.NEXT I SHALL DISCUS WITH YOU ABOUT THE PROJECTS I HAVE WORKED IN.

IN THESE 4 YRS I HAVE WORKED ON 3 PROJECTS----
1)DATA MODELLING
2)SQL DEVELOPEment
3)PYTHON development

IN ONE OF MY ENGAGEMENTS,I WAS WORKING FOR MARUTI SUZUKI CLIENT,WHERE THEY WERE MIGRATING THE ON PREMISE DATA TO AWS CLOUD ENVIRONMENT.
 PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
SO HERE THE DATA WAS HUGE AND ON A REGULER BASIS ITS GETTING INCREASED WHERE THE ON PREMISE INFRA WAS NOT COST EFFICIENT . HENCE THE CLIENT 
WANTED A REAL TIME SYSTEMS FOR WHICH CLOUD SERVICE WAS OPTED.
 
 METHODOLOGY:-
 
THE DATA WAS COMING FROM THE ORACLEDB WHERE THERE ARE MASTER TABLES AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONAL TABLES WITH DIFFERENT types of DATA LIKE CX DATA,PRODUCT DATA,
SALES DATA,ORDER RELATED DATA AND MANY MORE. MY PRIMARY task WAS TO ANALYZE THESE TABLES like ,
TO CHECK WHAT ARE THE COLUMNS,WHAT KIND OF DATA PRESENT IN IT,ANALYSE THE NULL VALUES,etc
AFTER ENTIRE ANALYSIS OF THESE TABLES
depending on WHICH ARE THE FUCTIONS TO BE USED FOR JOINING THEM AND FETCHING THE DATA,
WE HAD PREPARED FUCTIONAL SPECIFICATION DOCS FOR KPI AS WELL AS TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION DOCS FOR data mapping of columns from source to target 
WHICH HELPED US TO DESIGN THE ENTIRE ETL PROCESS OF THE DATA FROM SOURCE TO TARGET.
WE TOOK FORMAL SIGNOFF OF THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE CLIENT AND pushed THE DATA WITH THE HELP OF TALEND
FROM SOURCE TO S3  AND THEN TO SNOWFLAKES WITH THE HELP OF GLUE(all transformation and copy into command are well handles and written in glue script) .

 {OPTIMISE ENGINES,PIPELINE IN SNWFLKS,DATA FETCHED,JOIN ENGINES,5 GB TOTAL DATA,STREAM,CAPTURING SLOWLY CHANGING DIMENSION.}

 IN SNOWFLAKES WE USED SNOWPIPE FOR BUILDING  INJESTION PIPELINE for streaming data,USED JOIN ENGINES TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS JOINS,
 USED QUERY CACHING to use results of PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED QUERIES,PERFORM ALL THE NECESSARY TRANSFORMATIONS BY MERGING OR JOINING THE TABLES.
 
 AFTER THIS AS PER THE METRICS ,  AGGREGATIONS AND CALCULATIONS WERE PERFOMRED,LASTLY WE USED TO OPTIMIZE IT WITH VARIOUS METHODS.
 HEREAFTER WE DO OUR UNIT TESTING WITH THE QA TEAM TO CHECK THE VOLUME OF final DATA.
 POST THAT after  PASSing THE SANITY TEST  WE PUSHED OUR DATA TO THE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT SERVER 
 AS PER THE BUSINESS REQUIREMNT WHICH NEEDED YEARLY DATA , THE ONETIME LOADING ON YEARLY BASIS  WAS DONE AND SCHEDULED AND THE FINAL DATASET
 WAS GIVEN TO THE FRONT END TEAM FOR FURTHER BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE PROCEDURES.
 
 For VERSION CONTROLLING WE USED GIT HUB
 WE COMMIT THE CODE TO THE GIT BY CREATING OUR BRANCH , DOING THE NECESSARY IMPLEMENTATIONS , AND CREATING A PULL REQUEST TO MERGE THE CODE
 WITH MASTER AND DEVELOPER BRANCH.
