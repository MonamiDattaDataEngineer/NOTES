SIMPPLE STORAGE SERVICE (S3)----------------------------------


What is s3?-----------------------------

S3 is a flexible storage service which can store various types of data.It follows the key-value approach to store the objects in it.
Objects are replicated in SINGLE REGION OVER MULTIPLE AVAILABILITY ZONES

What is Storage class??-----------

STORAGE CLASS----Depending of various USE CASES AND ACCESS PATTERNS,AMAZON S3 has different STORAGE CLASS for cost optomization.
                 S3 STORAGE CLASS is used to optimize the COST as well as meeting the ACCESS TIME NEEDS.
1)STANDARD -- Frequently used Data
              Low Latency and High thouroughput
			  
2)STANDARD IA---Long lived Infrequently accessed data
                Less costly than STANDARD but with high retrieval fee.

3)ONE ZONE IA---Long lived,Infrequntly accesed data,non critical data with replication in One AZ
                Lest costly than STANDARD IA---Long

4)INTELLIGENT TIERING ----Long lived data with unpredictable ACCESS PATTERN
                          Automatically Moving Objects between two ACCESS TIERS(Frequent & Infrequent) depending on the changing ACCESS PATTERNS
						  making Automatic Cost Optimization.

5)GLACIER----Long time Archived the historical data with retrieval time of minutes to hours
             Very low cost storage design

6)GLACIER DEEP ARCHIVE ---Long term archive with retrieval time upto 12 hrs
                          Lowest cost storage class for rarely accessed data.



What is LIFECYCLE CONFIGURATION ? -----------------

The S3 LIFECYCLE CONFIGURATION is a set of policies which manages the Objects throughout their Lifecycles automatically transitioning 
betwenn different STORAGE CLASSES or EXPIRING them optomizing the cost.



ACL AND IAM OF S3 ? --------------------------

S3 ACL(ACCESS CONTROL LIST) enables us to access the buckets and objects of S3.
Each bucket or object has an ACL attached to it which defines which accounts or groups have access to it.
When a request is received ,s3 first checks  the corresponding ACl to verify that the requester has the ACCESS PERMISION


IAM is a service that provides a centralized control over the users and permissions across all aws services
ACL are used to control access to buckets and objects 

IAM allows you to create AWS users or groups and grant permissions using IAM policies
ACL defines which AWS accounts or pre defined groups have aceess to a bucket or object

DATA CATALOGUE---------

DATA CATALOGUE is a central repositiory that stores all the structured and non structured data.
DATA CATALOGUE automatically INDEXES your data,COLLECTS and STORES metadata, and makes the data readily SEARCHABLE and QUERIABLE by Athena,
Redshift Spectrum and Glue.


GLUE CRAWLER-----------

GLUE CRAWLER is a service that connects to the data soursce,determines the schema and create metadata tables in the GLUE CATALOGUE.
It can crawl multiple datastores in a single run and automatically handles new data that gets added to the data stores.


GLUE CRAWLER is the tool that discovers and catalogues the metadata from data store
GLUE CATALOGUE is where the metadata of the data is stored and managed.



GLUE,Lambda-----serverless platform where python,pyspark,java codes,etc could be executed


Athena---diectly query from s3


EC2---Instance(computer)
EMR----(cluster of instances)

databases----Redshift,Dynamodb,Mongodb,Auroradb
