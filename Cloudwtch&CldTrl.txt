CLOUDTRAIL----

AWS Cloudtrail tracks events,WEBAPI and any changes made in AWS resources.:
1>>Precisely who made the request?
2>>What action perfomred?
3>>What parameters being passed?
4>>What is the end result?

Cloutrail is most useful for troubleshooting:
Suppose an EC2 instance is missing,then we need to find out how it got missing then we can go to Cloudtrail and find out
Cloutrail delivers log files to S3(by default) or to cloudwatch
Cloudtrail log files can be encrypted using AMAZON SSE
Cloudtrail Log files can be archived using S3 Lifecycle groups

How to create CloudTrail?
Cloudtrail>>>Trails>>Create Trails---We can create Trails to deliver logs to S3 bucket(default) or even Cloudwatch Logs
Name the Cloudtrail>>>Cloose whether multiregion Trail or Single region trail
Then we have to choose what events we have to write---readOnly or Both ReadnWrite
Another thing we have to configure is Data Events:We can track resource events tats performed on or withing the Resource
Eg:We can track if Object is being added or deleted from S3
Next we have to choose the s3 bucket where we want to send all the informations




CLOUDWATCH------

AWS CLOUDWATCH is a monitoring and obvervability service.
AWS CLOUDWATCH sends monitoring and operational data in various forms--in form of logs,metrics and events.
AWS CLOUWATCH can be used to set alarms,visualise cloudwatch,take immediate actions on the basis of alarms and evens.

We can create AWS CLOUDWATCH alarms based on various metrics--
Ec2 CPU utilization
SQS queue length
We can create Amazon CLOUDWATCH Dashboard with auto Refreshed Graphs and add all the important Cloudwatch metrics to it:
we open the cloudwatchthere is dashboard option,nae it and create dashboard.
In here we can add the type of metrics,we can select line metrics
In here we can choose which metrics we want to select,lets pick up Lambda metrics and we have to pick up a Resource 

Amazon CLOUDWATCH Events enables us to take immediate action on AWS Resource:
We can call a LAMBDA function once the EC2 instance starts
We notify Amazon SNS when an Autoscaling event happens


CLOUDWATCH VS CLOUDTRAIL----------

CLOUDWATCH is the inner working of an application
Cloudtrail is used when we want to know which user or resource did which API actions:
who created the s3 bucket
who changed the concurrency settings of a lambda function

CLOUDWATCH IS FOR MONITOR AND LOGGING OF INTERNAL WORKINGS OF AN APPLICATION
CLOUDTRAIL IS TO TRACK  ALL API ACTIVITIED IN THE ACCOUNT
