SNOWFLAKES---

1) WHAT IS SNOWFLAKES?

SNOWFLAKES is a CLOUDBASED DATA WAREHOUSE SERVICE for STORAGE,PROCESSING AND ANALYTICS.
SNOWFLAKES  offers a SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE,i.e,developers can focus on development while server management is fully automated.
SNOWFLAKES supports MULTICLOUD ENVIRONMENTS AND SWITCH BETWEEN THEM EASILY


2)VIRTUAL WREHOUSE?

VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE in snowflakes are seperate COMPUTE CLUSTERS to perform DATA PROCESSING TASKS.
Has seperate storage and processing units.
OPERATES INDEPENDANTLY without sharing COMPUTE RESOURCES with each other.
HENCE ALLOWS MULTIPLE USERS/TEAMS to run queries simultenously without affecting each other's performance.


3)TIME TRAVEL?

TIME TRAVLE in SNOWFLAKES allows to ACCESS HISTORICAL DATA at any point witin a RETENTION period of minimum 1 day to max 90 days.
USEFUL FOR RETRIEVAL OF DATA during accidental deletion or mofification of data or audits of data.


4) FAIL SAFE?

AFTER THE DEFINED TIME TRAVEL PERIOD is elapsed, THE HISTORICAL DATA MOVE TO THE FAIL SAFE
DURING THIS PERIOD THE DATA CAN BE RECOVERED ONLY BY SNOWFLAKE.
FAILSAFE KEEPS THE DATA FOR NON CONFIGURABLE 7 DAY PERIOD.


5)MICROPARTITIONS ?

SNOWFLAKES automatically divides the data into many micro-partitions.Groups of rows are mapped into the micropartion organised in a columnar pattern.
(depending on the certain range of values of low cardinal column.) 
MICRO PARTITIONS CONTAIN INFOS ABOUT THE DATA LIKE DATA RANGE, MAX/MIN DATE,AND OTHER METRICS.

BENEFITS >>> 

TABLE DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY PARTITIONED AND NO MANUAL INTERVENTION NEEDED
VERY MUCH SMALL RESULTING IN EFFICIENT DML AND FINE GRAINED PRUNING FOR FASTER QUERIES
COLUMNAR STORAGE FOR FASTER QUERY WHERE ONLY REFERENCED FIELD IS SCANNED--columns are stored independantly in micropartition
CLUMNS ARE COMPRESSED INDIVIDUALY WITHIN MICROPARTITIONS.SNOWFLAKE DETERMINE AUTOMATICALLY THE MOST EFFICIENT COMPRESSION ALGORITHM FOR CLM COMPRESSION



6)DATA CLUSTERING ??

IT IS THE TECHNIQUE OF STORING THE DATA IN A SORTED.ORDERED MANNED ALONG NATURAL DIMENSIONS(like date/geographical regions).
Co-locating similar rows in the same micropartition using CLUSTERING keys improve query performace.
COLUMNS ON WHICH CLUSTERING IS DONE ARE CHOSEN ON THE BASIS OF QUERY PATTERNS.
LOW CARDINAL COLUMNS ARE CHOSEN.WE CAN ALSO RELY ON SNOWFLAKES FOR AUTOMATIC CLUSTERING.



7) RESOURCE MONITORS ?

IT TRACKS AND CONTROL THE COMPUTE CLUSTER CONSUMPTIONS AND KEEPTS THE USAGE UNDER BUDGET.



8)IMPROVE DATA LOADING PERF

USING LARGE FILES FOR LOADING TO AVOID OVERHEAD OF SMALL FILES.
USING PROPER FILE FORMATS LIKE ARQUET AND ORC FOR HIGH COMPRESSION
RUNNING MULTIPLE PARALLEL COPY COMMND CAN MAXIMIZE THOROUGHPUT


9)  How would you scale warehouses dynamically based on load?

WE DONT NEED TO scale,AS SNOWFLAKES AUTOSCALING FEATURE AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST NUMBR OF CLUSTERS IN THE MULTI CLUSTER WAREHOUSE.



10) STREAMS AND TASKS IN SNOWFLAKES ?
 
STREAMS in SNOWFLAKES CAPTURES THE DATA MANUPULATION LANGUAGE(DML) CHANGES LIKE INSERT, UPDATE OR DELETE
IT ENABLES US TO SEE THE HISTORY OF CHANGES TO DATA.

TASKS in snowflakes help us to SCHEDULE THE AUTOMATED SQL  QUERIES OFTEN ON THE BASIS OF CHANGES TRACKED BY STREAMS

TOGETHER STREAMS & TASKS ARE USED TO AUTOMATE AND ORCHESTRATE THE INCREMENTAL WORKFLOWS




11) INTEGRATE DATALAKE  & SNOWFLAKES ?

YES.tHIS IS POSSIBLE !
SNOWFLAKES USE ITS EXTERNAL TABLE TO QUERY THE DATA STORED IN THE EXTERNAL STORAGE LIKE AMAZONE S3, AZURE DATA LAKE OR GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE.
THIS SETUP ENABLES THE USERS TO LEVERAGE THE SCALIBILITY OF DATA LAKE STORAGE OF RAW DATA AND SNOWFLAKES POWERFUL COMPUTING CAPABILITIES 
FOR QUERYING AND ANALYSING DATA WITHOUT ACTUALLY MOVING IT TO SNOWFLAKES.

integration code
syntax for creation of stage,table,file format



12) SNOWFLAKE AND SEMI STRUCTURED DATA ?

SNOWFLAKES CAN VERY WELL HANDLE SEMI STRUCTURED DATA FORMAT LIKE JSON XML CSV ETC
IT CAN INGEST SEMI STRUCT DATA ITO THE ENGINE WITHOUT HAVING ANY PREDEFINED SCHEMA WITH THE HELP OF VARIANT TYPE COLUMN
WE CAN THEN USE SNOWFLAKES POWERFUL SQL ENGINE TO QUERY AND TRANSFORM THE DATA JUST LIKE STRUCTURED DATA
THIS IS PARTICULERLY HELPFUL FOR SCHEMA EVOLUTION AS IT CAN DYNAMICALLY PARSE AND INDENTIFY THE STRUCTURE WHEN QUERIED.



fileformat------

fileformat is the set of rules that tells the snowflake what are the file formats that are being injested into the table.
inside it it has bunch of paframeters.
field delimeter,fileformats etc

After this stage is created with reference to s3 location
We can list the items---shows those similar to s3 objects

Use copy into command to load data into snowflake
